Parallelizing a pipeline is unlikely to increase its performance if the source
is from Stream.iterate, or the intermediate operation limit is used.

Do not parallelize stream pipelines indiscriminately

Performance gains from parallelization are best on streams over ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet

Not only can parallelizing a stream lead to poor performance, including liveness failures,
it can lead to incorrect results and unpredicatable behaviour
