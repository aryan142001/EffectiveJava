Java Deserialzation can be a danger as deserializing untrusted streams
can result in remote code execution, denial of service and other exploits.
Application can be vulnerable to these attacks even if they did nothing wrong.

Prefer alternatives to JAVA Serialization

Use JSON or Protobuf instead

If you have no other alternate for java serialization make use of java.io.ObjectInputFilter
