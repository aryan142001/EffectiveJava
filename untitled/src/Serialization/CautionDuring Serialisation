A major cost of implementing Serializable is that it decreases the flexibility
to change a class's implementation once it has been released

Another cost is is increases the likelyhood of bugs and security holes

It increases testing burder associated with releasing a new version of class

classes ddesigned for inheritance should rarely implement Serializable, and
inetrfaces should rarely extend it [Reason in The OOPS concepts being used]
