1) Use the == operator for same ref check

2) Use the instanceOf operator for correct type

3) Cast the argument to correct type

4) For each significant field in the class check equality

After writing equals method check if it is symmetric, transitive and consistent

ChatGPT it best way


When a super class has defined equals method use composition when want to create a type of subtype of it

Note:-
For primitive -> ==
For Float and Double -> .equals() will affect performance
Use @AutoValue framework
