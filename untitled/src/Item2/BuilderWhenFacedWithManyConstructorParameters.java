 * Luckily, there is a third alternative that combines the safety of the

 * Therefore, itâ€™s often better to start with a builder in the first place.
 *
 * In summary, the Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose
 * constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of parameters,
 * especially if many of the parameters are optional or of identical type.
